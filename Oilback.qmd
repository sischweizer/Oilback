# Welcome to Oilbck
![Main Banner Image](Pictures/Banner.jpg)

## Our Mission
We aim to revolutionize the metal manufacturing industry through the integration of Circular Economy principles. By reclaiming and reusing cutting fluids from oily metal chips, we reduce waste, emissions, and manufacturing costs.

*This section introduces the main mission of Oilbck.*

## Problem Overview
The metal manufacturing industry produces significant waste in the form of oily metal chips, which leads to high costs and environmental harm. Currently, manufacturers must dispose of this waste through inefficient methods.

**Current issues:**
- Metal chips with 20% oil content by weight
- Inefficient off-site recycling processes
- High waste disposal costs

## Our Solution
We bring the recycling process to the manufacturerâ€™s site! Our mobile recycling units separate oil and metal chips, allowing the oil to be reused, and the metal chips sent directly to recycling.

**Advantages:**
- On-site oil recycling reduces waste
- Cost savings on oil and disposal
- Reduced environmental impact
